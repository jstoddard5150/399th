                <h4>At 55 years of continuous service at its home of Fort Leonard Wood, the 399th Army Band has been on post longer than any other unit. 
              The band was first activated 65 years ago on 1 June 1944 as the 399 Army Service Forces Band in Naples, Italy. This new unit was 
              made primarily of personnel from the recently-deactivated 6498th Army Band, successor of the 9th Cavalry Band. Originally assigned 
              27 enlisted Soldiers and no officers, this band performed at concerts, parades, dances and ceremonies throughout Italy. 
              The unit earned battle credit for participation in the ROME-ARNO Campaign in 1944.</h4><br><br>
                <h4>After a short time in Italy, the 399 ASF Band moved to France in November 1944. A second battle participation credit was awarded for 
                   the Central Europe Campaign, 25 June 1945. The band migrated again to Bremen, Germany. There the band participated in large concerts joining with                      multiple German civilian ensembles. Bob Hope’s USO Show was one of the band’s major venues during its time in Germany. The 399 ASF Band also performed for 
                  the Federal British Corps. Dances, parades, and military concerts kept the band busy while supporting both American and Allied troops. 
                  The “Rough Riders,” their popular dance orchestra, performed almost nightly. A third battle participation credit was awarded to the 
                  unit on 12 December 1945 for the Rhineland Campaign. On 5 September 1946, the band officially accepted its current name, the 
                  399th Army Band. The 399th Army Band ended its tour of Europe when it was inactivated on 20 January 1947.</h4>  <br><br> 
               <h4>The band was reactivated for a brief time in the Organized Reserves from 13 November 1947 to 5 May 1949. Until 7 March 1955, the 
                  unit remained inactive. It was reactivated in the Regular Army at the US Army Training Center Engineers and Fort Leonard Wood, 
                  Missouri, where the unit resides today. The new 399th Army Band was made up of members of the 326th Army Band, which was deactivated 
                  on the same day. Basic Combat Training and Advanced Individual Training graduations were weekly commitments from the unit’s first 
                  week at Fort Leonard Wood. The 6th Armored Division Band was also stationed at Fort Leonard Wood, and when deactivated, replaced 
                  with the 423rd Army Band. The 423rd and 399th shared both rehearsal space and performance responsibilities, often combining for
                  major events. The bands regularly performed for graduations, Change of Command ceremonies, retirement ceremonies, holiday 
                  celebrations, parades and sporting events on post, as well as community events, concerts, and occasional charitable benefits in the 
                  surrounding communities. The 423rd Army Band was disbanded in 1969, leaving the 399th the only band on Fort Leonard Wood.</h4><br><br>
                  <h4>To this day, the 399th Army Band continues to serve Fort Leonard Wood and the surrounding area. We are proud of the unit’s rich 
                  history and to be the premiere musical organization of Fort Leonard Wood. Our vision remains: Building strong Warriors, Leaders, 
                  Familes and Forces!</h4>
